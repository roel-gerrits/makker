Goals and Vision

# Multi language
Not made for a specific language

# Configuration over convention
No assumptions about fixed directory structures

# Parallel by default
Why not?

# Let the build tool do the building
No need to specify names for files you don't care about.
The build tool is responsible for managing build artifacts.
Clean should never be required
